<!-- 
1. What is the purpose of a Git repository and how does it help Front-End developers? 
It allows developers to easily return to any previous version of the code.

2. What is the difference between tracked and untracked files in Git? Why can untracked files cause issues? 
Tracked files: Files that the developer has added to Git and committed. Git monitors any new changes in them. 
Untracked files: Files that exist in the project but Git is not tracking them yet (not added with git add).

3. What is the importance of a .gitignore file in Front-End projects? 
The .gitignore file specifies which files/folders Git should ignore. 
Example: node_modules/ in JavaScript or React projects.

4. Why is viewing the History important in Front-End projects? 
When multiple versions of a website exist: 
- You can see exactly who changed what and when. 
- You can easily roll back to a stable version if an error occurs. 

5. What is GitHubâ€™s role compared to a Local Repository? And what is the value of GitHub Pages? 
GitHub: An online platform to store and share projects. 
Local repository = on your computer. 
Remote repository (GitHub) = a version stored on the internet, where you can push updates to or pull from.
GitHub Pages: lets you host and view your HTML/CSS/JS project online with a live URL.
